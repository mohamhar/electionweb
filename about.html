            <h5>I  am the Founder and past President of New Brunswick Little League for 5 years. Coaching since 2006, I coached Baseball/Softball, Basketball, and Soccer. I played Little League as a child growing up in Newark and wanted to give my son and all the children in New Brunswick the same opportunity I had to compete with other neighboring towns. ​ I knew that this level of completion can improve New Brunswick Children's baseball skills and make them feel a sense of accomplishment in addition to assisting the Middle and High Schools get better players.  I am a proud father of three children all born in New Brunswick with one being hearing impaired. I  had to consistently advocate for them to make sure they got the best education available to them. I now wishes to use my skills to advocate for all the children of New Brunswick. Two of my children graduated from the New Brunswick Health Science Technology High School and one is currently a student. I graduated from Rutgers University with a degree in Industrial Engineering and a minor in Psychology. During my tenure at Rutgers University, I was a student leader and organized activities/events for the Rutgers Community. One year, I was awarded Hall President of the Year for one of my programs that brought the Rutgers Community together with music including faculty, students and custodians.</h5>
