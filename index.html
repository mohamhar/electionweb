	Jerry B. Mercado is the current President and Founder of New Brunswick Little League.
	Coaching since 2006, he coaches Baseball, Basketball, and Soccer. He saw the need for
	New Brunswick children to compete with other neighboring towns so they can improve
	their skills and feel a sense of accomplishment. He is also a father of three children all born in New Brunswick with one being hearing
	impaired. He has to be consistently advocating for his children to make sure they get the
	best education available to them. He now wishes to use his skills to advocate for all the
	children of New Brunswick.He graduated from Rutgers University with a degree in Industrial Engineering and a
	minor in Psychology. During his tenure at Rutgers University he was a student leader and
	organized activities and events for the Rutgers Community.
